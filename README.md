Working on creative skills, dreaming of brighter futures.

My areas of focus are games and applications made with Godot, with an emphasis on living worlds with strong narratives and uniquely tailored UIs.

I'm eager to learn from the more experienced or collaborate with others on projects of personal interest.
Primarily focused on GDScript learning for now, and will eventually branch out into Python. (Maybe even C# and something network related, who knows.)

Best way to reach me is on discord, my tag is: @lukysa
